## <u>Data Modeling Diagrams</u>

### **Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD)**

Provide a data-focused view of the main data objects or entities within a system such as a person, place or object and the relationships between them. It is a high-level view and does not consider the detailed attributes or characteristics of an object such as a person’s name or address.

**Steps for Developing an ERD**

- <i>Identify Identities</i> <br>
An Entity is an object such as a person, place, thing or event about which we need to capture and store data. An entity forms a dataset about a particular object.
- <i>Workout Relationships</i> <br>
- <i>Identify Attributes</i> <br>
- <i>Identify Cardinality</i> <br>
- <i>Identify KEY attributes</i> <br>
- <i>Resolve Assumptions</i> <br>

**Design Guidelines**

- Best practicies rather than rules
- Entities should have many occurances
- Avoid unnecessary attributes
- Clearly label all the components
- Apply correct Cardinality
- Break attributies into lowest level needed
- Labels should reflect common business terms
- Assumptions should be clearly stated


### **Balancing ERDs with DFDs**
DFDs stand for DaraFlow Diagram

- All analysis activities are interrelated
- Process model contains two main data componenets :- <br>Data flows and Data stores
- The DFD data components need to balance the ERD’s data stores (entities) and data elements (attributes)
- Many CASE tools provide features to check for imbalance
- Check that all data stores and elements correspond between models


### **Information Flow Diagram (IFD)**
It is a simple diagram showing how information is routed between different parts of an organisation. It has an information focus rather than a process focus.

**Its purpose**
- to document the main flows of information around the organisation
- for analyst to check and that they have understood the flows and they have not been omitted
- the analyst may use them during the fact-finding process itself as an accurate and efficient way to document findings as they are identified;
